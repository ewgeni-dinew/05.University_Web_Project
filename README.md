# 05.University_Web_Project
In this repository i will be submitting one of my university projects. As of Jan.2018 I am a first year student in the PU(Plovdiv University),studying Software Engineering in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. We were given a task to create our own non-functioning website, using HTML5 and CSS technologies. The site had to consist of at least 3 pages: home, register and a personal choice. It had to have a responsive design with responsive breakpoints, making the pages easily visible from different devices.  The goal of the project was for us to successfully create a good-looking website from scratch, with basic HTML and CSS knowledge. I will be using JetBrains WebStorm 2017.2.5.
