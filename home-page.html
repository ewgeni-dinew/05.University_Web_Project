                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                    specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
                    Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots
                    in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years
                    old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                    looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
                    passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
                    discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32
                    and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil)
                    by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
                    very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
                    dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

                <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
                    content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
                    that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
                    'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
                    publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
                    text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
                    infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
                    sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority
                    have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words
                    which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of
                    Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
                    middle of text.</p>
                <p>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat
                    predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the
                    Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful
                    of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.</p>
                <p>
                    The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected
                    humour, or non-characteristic words etc. Look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of
                    Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
                    middle of text.</p>

                <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and
                    praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and
                    expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
                    of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because
                    it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
                    encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who
                    loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
                    because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him
                    some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes
                    laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has
                    any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no
                    annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant
                    pleasure?</p>
